# pfSense IoT Multicast
A walkthrough of configuring pfSense with Avahi and PIMD for multicast to use with casting devices where displaying devices are on an IOT network and user devices are on LAN


# Install required packages
Install Avahi and PIMD packages from the Package Manager

# Step 1: Service Setup
## *Services > Avahi*:

<p>

\**Note: Do not enable yet\**
> - Action: set to "Allow Interfaces"
> - Interfaces: ctrl+select interfaces to listen on (LAN and IOT)
> - Uncheck: Disable support for IPv4
> - Check: Disable support for IPv6
> - Check: Enable Reflection
> - Publishing: Enable all publishing
> - Advanced settings: no change
> - **Save**

</p>

## *Services > PIMD*:
### *PIMD > General*:
<p>

\**Note: Do not enable yet\**
> - Default Bind: "Bind to All"
> - Log Level: "Debug" for troubleshooting/startup, otherwise Warning
> - CARP: none
> - General Settings: *Leave all blank*
> - Threshold Type: "Default"
> - **Save**
</p>

### *PIMD > Interfaces* tab:

<p>

> - **+Add**
> - *Select interface to exclude (start with WAN)*
> - **Save**
  > - *Repeat for IOT and any additional interfaces*
</p>

### *PIMD > BSR Candidates* tab:

> - **+Add**
> - Interface: "default"
> - **Save**
</p>

### *PIMD > RP Candidates* tab:
</p>

> - **+Add**
> - NO CHANGE - Leave at Interface: "default"
> - **Save**
</p>

### *PIMD > RP Addresses*:
<p>

> - NO CHANGE - do not add any entries here
</p>

# Step 2: Firewall Alias setup
## *Firewall > Aliases*:
### *Aliases > IP*:
<p>

Adding the full multicast range...
> - **+Add**
> - Name: "MulticastRange_Full"
> - Type: Network(s)
> - Network of FQDN: 224.0.0.0 /3
> - Description: "Multicast IP range from 224.0.0.1-239.255.255.255"
> - **Save**
</p>

<p>

Adding the devices that will be displaying media, like Chromecast, Roku, etc.
> - **+Add**
> - Name: "CastingDevices"
> - Type: Host(s)
> - Network of FQDN: <IP of cast device>
> - Description: <Description of device>
> - **+Add Host** and repeat for each device you will be viewing content on
> - **Save**
</p>

<p>

Additional alias for allowing access anywhere **but** private networks for IOT or other guest networks used later
> - **+Add**
> - Name: "Private_Networks"
> - Type: Network(s)
> - Network of FQDN: <Full IP pool of subnet on private interface> 
> - Description: Name of network pool or interface
> - Repeat for each private network
> - **Save**
</p>

<p>

### Aliases>Ports::
Add the ports commonly used in multicast advertising to one alias
> - **+Add** (Hint: use import button and copy/pasta the list below)
> - Name: "CastingPorts"
> - Type: Port(s)
> - Enter each of the below ports: (Covers most all Chromecast, Roku, Sonos devices)\ 
>   - *Hint: use the import button*
> 
    5353
    1900
    8008
    8009
    8443
    5556
    5558
>    
> - **Save**
</p>

# Step 3: Firewall Rule Setup
## *Firewall > Rules*:
### *Rules > Floating*:
<p>

> - **+Add**
> - Action: Pass
> - Uncheck: Disabled
> - Check: Quick
> - Interface: <Select same networks as Avahi setup above - networks to incude in multicast>
> - Direction: any
> - Address family: IPv4
> - Protocol: IGMP
> - Source: any
> - Destination: Single host or alias : "MulticastRange_Full" alias
> - Log: Check to start, can be disabled
> - Description: "Allow <networks> IGMP to multicast address range"
> - SHOW ADVANCED::
> - Checked: Allow IP Options
> - **Save**
</p>

### *Rules > LAN*:
<p>


*Note: The below repeated rule may be possible with a single floating rule using direction "Out"*

> - **+Add**
> - Action: Pass
> - Uncheck: Disabled
> - Interface: LAN (repeat for other interface(s)
> - Address family: IPv4
> - Protocol: UDP
> - Source: any
> - Destination: Single host or alias : "MulticastRange_Full" alias
> - Port(s): (other)  custom:"CastingPorts" alias
> - Log: Check to start, can be disabled
> - Description: "Allow <networks> UDP to multicast address range"
> - SHOW ADVANCED::
> - Checked: Allow IP Options
> - **Save**

> - ^^Repeat the above for IOT network(s)^^

</p>



### Add the following rules in top down order in the **IOT** network

<p>

> ### Allow devices to the Multicast Range of IPs
> - **+Add** above (top)
> - Action: Pass
> - Interface: Select IOT network
> - Address family: IPv4
> - Protocol: UDP
> - Source: any
> - Port: any
> - Destination: Single host or alias : "MulticastRange_Full" alias
> - Destination Port(s): (other) : "CastingPorts" alias
> - Log: Check to start, can be disabled later
> - Description: "Allow casting devices to advertise mDNS or SSDP"
> - **Save**

</p>

<p>

> ### Allow output devices to the LAN
> - **+Add** above 
> - Action: Pass
> - Interface: Select IOT network
> - Address family: IPv4
> - Protocol: any
> - Source: Single host or alias : "CastingDevices" alias
> - Destination: "LAN net"
> - Log: Check to start, can be disabled
> - Description: "Allow only casting devices to LAN"
> - SHOW ADVANCED::
> - Checked: Allow IP Options
> - **Save**
> - Move to 2nd down

</p>

<p>

> ### Allow IOT network devices to go anwhere but the LAN
> #### *Recommended additional rule to block IOT devices besides your output devices from LAN and other networks*
> - **+Add** 
> - Action: Pass
> - Interface: Select IOT network
> - Address family: IPv4
> - Protocol: any
> - Source: IOT net
> - Destination: CHECK "invert match"  Single host or alias : "Private_Networks" alias
> - Log: Check to start, can be disabled
> - Description: "Allow IOT anywhere but private networks"
> - **Save**
> - move to 3rd down

</p>


# Step 4: Configuration File Modification - Fix TTL
## *Diagnostics > Edit File*

<p>
Modifying the filter.inc config file

> - Diagnostics>Edit File
> - Browse to: /etc/inc/filter.inc
> - Find under "function filter_generate_scrubbing() {...
> - Directly under **\$scrubrules = "";** paste the following lines and edit them accordingly. Be sure to maintain indent at same level of "$scrubrules"
>   - Hint: Ctrl+F and search for

    $scrubrules = "";

##########COPY BELOW##########

            /* The following 2 lines were added to fix TTL of 1 in multicast */
                $scrubrules .= "scrub in on \$<NameOfIOTInterface - IOT> inet proto udp from <IP network of IOT in CIDR format - 192.168../24> to 239.255.255.250 port 1900 min-ttl 2 {$scrubnodf} {$scrubrnid}     {$mssclamp} fragment reassemble\n";
                $scrubrules .= "scrub in on \$<NameOfLANInterface - LAN> inet proto udp from <IP network of LAN in CIDR format - 192.168../24> to 239.255.255.250 port 1900 min-ttl 2 {$scrubnodf} {$scrubrnid}     {$mssclamp} fragment reassemble\n";

##########COPY ABOVE##########

> - *Be sure to update information between <> components and remove the <> symbols.*
> - Click **Save**.
</p>

<p>

# Step 5: Enabling Services
## *Services > Avahi*:
> - Check: Enable
> - **Save**

## *Services > PIMD*:
> - Check: Enable
> - **Save**

Reboot to refresh rules, states, and new filter.inc file. NOTE: The above lines may need to be re-added after a version update!!

Once the network comes back up, monitor mobile devices for new destinations in the cast list.
